#### Note: All code has comments to specify what's happening. Unfortunately, I was not able to write a unit test due to time constraints, but I would've liked to!

### Thank you so much for considering me! I would really love to be a junior front-end developer on your team, as I'm a fast learner and a great team player, and I'm always excited to ask questions and learn more. 
### Thank you again! -Claire
